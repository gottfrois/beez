# Welcome on Beez 👋

Simple efficient ruby workers for [Zeebe](https://zeebe.io/), the workflow
Engine for Microservices Orchestration.

[Zeebe](https://zeebe.io/) is a free and source-available workflow engine for
microservices orchestration. [Zeebe](https://zeebe.io/) scales orchestration of
workers and microservices using visual workflows.

![Zeebe Operate](https://github.com/gottfrois/beez/blob/master/assets/images/zeebe-operate.jpeg?raw=true)

## Why Zeebe and Beez? ❓

* Zeebe lets you define workflows visually in [BPMN 2.0](http://www.bpmn.org/)
* Beez integrates with you Rails application
* Beez runs your workers asynchronously
* Beez automatically marks your jobs as failures uppon Ruby exceptions
* Beez has very few dependencies

## Disclaimer ⚠️

* Beez is currently a pre-release
* Beez has currently **not being tested in production**
* Beez is currently lacking unit tests, any help is welcome!

## Getting Started 🎓

These instructions will help you get started with [Zeebe](https://zeebe.io/)
and Beez. [Zeebe](https://zeebe.io/) already provides an extensive [documentation](https://docs.zeebe.io/)
I highly suggest you to check out before.

### Prerequisites ☔️

* You need [Zeebe up and running](https://docs.zeebe.io/introduction/install.html)
* Ruby >= 2.5 & < 2.7
* Rails >= 4 (optional)

### How It Works ⚙️

Workflows are flowchart-like blueprints that define the orchestration of tasks.
Every task represents a piece of business logic such that the ordered execution
produces a meaningful result.

Beez lets you define job workers as Ruby classes which is your implementation of
the business logic required to complete a task.

Running a workflow then requires two steps:

1. Submitting the workflow to Zeebe
2. Creating job workers that can request jobs from Zeebe and complete them

### Installation ☕️

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'beez', '~> 0.1'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install beez

### Usage 🎆

Let's start by creating some workers. In your Rails application, those would be
defined under `app/jobs` or `app/workers` for example.

```ruby
class MyWorker
  include ::Beez::Worker

  type "service-task-name"
  max_jobs_to_activate 5 # optional, default to 1
  poll_interval 1 # optional, default to 5
  timeout 30 # optional, default to 30

  def process(job)
    # do something
  end
end
```

Each worker automatically polls for new jobs at `poll_interval` interval. They
are configured to accepts a `max_jobs_to_activate` jobs at the same time.
Workers have exactly `timeout` seconds to process the job before the broker
consider it as expired and schedule it to another worker.

The `process` instance method receives a `job` instance which holds the job's
attributes such as the `variables` the job received. You can get the complete
list of attributes available [here](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-client-ruby/blob/master/lib/zeebe/client/proto/gateway_pb.rb#L20-L32)

Assuming you have [Zeebe](https://zeebe.io/) up and running, simply start Beez
from the root of your Rails application:

```sh
bundle exec beez
```

That's it.

### Configuration 🔧

Beez comes configured with global sane defaults but you can always
overrides them using either env variables in some cases or the `configure`
block:

```ruby
# Here are the global defaults already configured for you
Beez.configure do |config|
  config.env = ENV["APP_ENV"] || ENV["RAILS_ENV"] || ENV["RACK_ENV"] || "development"
  config.logger = Logger.new($stdout)
  config.require = "."
  config.timeout = 30
  config.zeebe_url = ENV['ZEEBE_URL'] || 'localhost:26500'
end
````

### Example

Let's get the full picture by deploying the following workflow to Zeebe and
define simple workers as plain Ruby objects.

![Order Process](https://docs.zeebe.io/getting-started/img/tutorial-3.0-complete-workflow.png)

1. Start Zeebe and Zeebe Operate:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-docker-compose
cd zeebe-docker-compose/operate
docker-compose up
```

2. Head to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

* Login: `demo`
* Password: `demo`

3. Start Beez using our example workers located at [`examples/workers.rb`](https://github.com/gottfrois/beez/blob/master/examples/workers.rb):

```sh
beez --timeout 5 --require examples/workers.rb
```

4. Start an `irb` session:

```sh
irb -r beez
```

5. Interact with Zeebe directly from the gem:

```ruby
2.6.6 :001 > # Deploy a workflow to Zeebe
2.6.6 :002 > Beez.client.deploy_workflow(workflows: [name: "order-process", type: :BPMN, definition: File.read('/path/to/beez/bpmn/order-process.bpmn')])
2.6.6 :003 > # Create a new instance of this workflow
2.6.6 :004 > Beez.client.create_workflow_instance(bpmnProcessId: "order-process", version: 1, variables: { orderId: "1234", orderValue: 94 }.to_json)
2.6.6 :005 > # Watch Beez automatically executing the first task!
2.6.6 :006 > # Publish a business message to simulate a payment received event
2.6.6 :007 > Beez.client.publish_message(name: "payment-received", correlationKey: "1234")
```

That's it!

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
